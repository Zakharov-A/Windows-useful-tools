An important part of any operating system is documentation,
the technical manuals which describe the operation and use of programs.
As part of its efforts to create a high-quality free operating system, 
the Parrot Project is making every effort to provide all of its users 
with proper documentation in an easily accessible form.

The documentation is a continuous Work in Progress (WIP), and all Parrot users are invited to contribute to the
creation and translation process of this portal.
